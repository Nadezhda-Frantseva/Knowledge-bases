A Knowledge Base (KB) is a structured repository of information that stores, organizes, and manages knowledge in a way that allows for efficient retrieval and reasoning. Knowledge bases can be used by humans or artificial intelligence systems to support decision-making, problem-solving, and automated reasoning.
